## Group 3 Members:  
Sierra Bispo - (Home)  
Melanie Halem - (Meet the Characters)  
Joseph Carter - (Inside Out 1)  
Nayllah Buteau (Leader) - (Achievements) 
## Commit History
All group members were able to contribute to this project and successfully create their respective webpage.   

Each member pushed through various commits as they worked through the project over the previous weeks to ensure edits were saved to the repository for another member to review. 

**Nayllah** pushed through 5 commits due to the following:  
-  First 2 commits were done to create the base of the repository which included the README, index, and css files
- The 3rd and 4th commits were done to create the achievements webpage
- The 5th commit was to push final edits to the overall webpage and add in details for the README file

**Melanie** pushed through 4 commits to create the "Meet the Characters" webpage. Each commit was pushed through once various milestones were completed throughout the weeks.

**Sierra** pushed through 2 commits to create the "Home" webpage. The first commit was done to create the overall layout and styling of the webapge and the second commit consisted of final edits.

**Joseph** was able to push through 1 commit to create the "Inside Out 1" webpage due to creating and completeing the layout, content, mobile responsiveness, and styling in one sitting and receiving confirmation from group that no further edits were needed.

## Challenges:
While creating the webpages, there were challenges in organizing the the CSS grid layout on "Meet the Characters" to ensure the thumbnails lined up accordingly. It was also a challenge getting the "Reviews" section to align perfectly using flexbox on the "Achievements" webpage. 

There were no other challenges while completeing this project.
