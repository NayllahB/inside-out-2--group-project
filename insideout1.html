            <p>At the start of the film, Riley’s life is turned upside down when her family moves from Minnesota to San Francisco. As Riley tries to adjust to her new environment, her emotions struggle to manage her feelings and reactions. Joy, the optimistic emotion, is typically in control, trying to keep Riley happy, while Sadness, a more downcast emotion, starts to make her presence felt. The core of the plot focuses on the conflict between Joy and Sadness. After a series of events, including a mishap that causes key memories of Riley’s childhood to become tainted with sadness, Joy and Sadness are accidentally swept out of the control center of Riley's mind and are forced to journey through different areas of her mind to get back. Meanwhile, the other emotions—Anger, Fear, and Disgust—are left to manage Riley’s actions in their absence. As Joy and Sadness work together, they learn that sadness has an important role to play in helping Riley process her emotions. The film culminates in Riley confronting her feelings of loss and homesickness and ultimately finding a way to express her emotions to her parents.</p>
