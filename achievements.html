                        <p class="review_p quote">"The beauty of "Inside Out 2" is that, different from all other Pixar sequels, it forces its creators to look inward to tell a story of character emotions that manages to resonate with every single audience member."</p>

                        <p class="review_p quote">"Inside Out 2 is a gem that’s as funny and creative as it is heartwarming. Though it’s aimed at kids, this movie brilliantly captures human emotions in a way anyone can relate to. The storyline is easy to follow yet layered with meaning, making it educational for young viewers and deeply resonant for adults. Fear, in particular, really stood out to me. This character is portrayed so accurately that it makes you reflect on your own inner anxieties. Pixar has, once again, taken a complex topic and made it feel personal and approachable. This is more than a children’s film; it’s a reminder that every emotion has value, and understanding them can enrich us all."</p>

                        <p class="review_p quote">"Watched this movie with my husband and we both teared up at different moments! I related so much to this movie because the past year has been filled with soooo much anxiety for me and the movie really showed all the complicated emotions that one experiences when going through high periods of stressful events and managing new and old relationships! I really liked how the story focuses on friendships this time around, whereas the first one revolved more around family. I would recommend watching inside out 1 before watching 2 if you haven't already, in order to understand what Riley (the main character) has gone through and so you can feel like you grew up with her! Disney and Pixar really did a great job with the animation, storyline, choice of character voices, and overall message on this one! I rate it 4.8/5 stars and would want to watch it again! The movie brought light and peace to my soul and made me really happy. Definitely a great family movie and a pick for people of all ages (an old grandma sitting next to us was crying, which made me feel even more emotional)."</p>

                        <p class="review_p quote">"Solid 10/10 it’s a really good movie when I watched it in theaters on the day it came out, I cried and laughed and more! It made me mix all my emotions into this movie and it also has a really good movie duration of 1h and 36mins in my opinion it’s a right time set not too much, not too little there is a reason this movie have a lot of perfect ratings because you can really relate to it. it teaches us a important life lesson: “all of your mistakes and your accomplishments is what your made of no matter how messy or bad we are all unique in our own ways”. If you haven’t seen this movie I do recommend watching it. I don’t know why there are some reviews here that have 1 star or say it’s bad if you do read those reviews take my advice and don’t listen to them they just probably don’t have any appreciation for these amazing movies. when you watch the movie I bet you are going to love this movie just us much as I did. Pixar and Disney really reached the top with Inside out 2."</p>
